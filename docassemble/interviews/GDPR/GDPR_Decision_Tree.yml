subquestion: |
  Does the information in question relate to an identified or identifiable natural person?
  
  <font size="2">
  Explanation:
  
  The GDPR protects only personal data of ***identified*** or ***identifiable*** natural persons. 
  
  An ***identifiable natural person*** is a natural person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. Just because you do not know the name of the person does not mean that the person is not identifiable. Examples of data that makes a person identifiable include IP addresses, cookies, or radio frequency tags. 
  
  Deceased natural persons are not protected by this Regulation. The GDPR does not cover data processing which concerns legal persons and undertakings established as legal persons, including the name and the form of the legal person and their contact details.
  
  For more information, consult the official GDPR [website](https://gdpr.eu/eu-gdpr-personal-data/).
